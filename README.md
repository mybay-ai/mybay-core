A self-hosted control plane for deploying and managing AI agent runtimes with Docker.

MyBay Open Source is the single-admin, local-first control plane for deploying, managing, and chatting with AI Agent instances (such as Hermes Agent).

This edition operates completely standalone with no hosted SaaS dependencies, cloud master nodes, registration flows, or paid quotas.

MyBay Open Source is the self-hosted community edition. The hosted MyBay service at [mybay.ai](https://mybay.ai) is a separate commercial offering and is not required to install or operate this repository.

> **Release status: Early Preview (`v0.1.2-preview`).** Public interfaces, runtime adapters, deployment details, and upgrade behavior may still change during the 0.x series.

## Relationship with Hermes Agent

MyBay is an independent open-source project. It is not an official Nous Research product and is not sponsored, endorsed, or maintained by Nous Research. Hermes Agent is a separate project maintained by Nous Research and distributed under the MIT License. MyBay interoperates with Hermes Agent through its public runtime and container interfaces.

See [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) for licensing and attribution details.

## Features

- **Single Admin Control Plane**: Dedicated local control panel for managing containerized AI agents.
- **On-machine SQLite**: Platform state is transactionally persisted in `data/mybay.sqlite`.
- **BYOK Model Configuration**: Bring Your Own Keys with OpenAI-compatible providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Ollama, etc.).
- **Agent Lifecycle Management**: One-click spawn, restart, hot update, status inspection, and log monitoring for local Docker containers.
- **Interactive Chat Workspace**: Full conversation interface with isolated run lifecycles, collapsible tool progress, step timing, Markdown, generated-file previews, safe downloads, and background completion notifications.
- **Docker Compose & Self-Hosting**: Ready-to-use `docker-compose.yml` for effortless container deployment.

## Deployment & Quick Start

### Method 1: Local Desktop Quick Start

Prerequisites: Docker Engine or Docker Desktop and Docker Compose. Host Node.js is not required. The macOS/Linux launcher additionally uses `openssl` and standard POSIX shell tools; the Windows launcher uses the built-in .NET cryptography APIs instead.

Use this mode when the browser and Docker run on the same computer:

**Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 7:**

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass
.\quick-start.ps1
```

**macOS or Linux:**

```bash
chmod +x quick-start.sh
./quick-start.sh
```

The control panel and Agent ports bind to `127.0.0.1` by default.
To share MyBay with devices on the same local network, bind one exact host address:

```bash
./quick-start.sh --lan 192.168.1.20
```

```powershell
.\quick-start.ps1 -Mode lan -LanBindIp 192.168.1.20
```

### Method 2: Public Server with Automatic HTTPS

Before starting, point the control-panel domain and the wildcard Agent domain to the server. Then run:

```powershell
.\quick-start.ps1 -Mode server
```

or on macOS/Linux:

```bash
chmod +x quick-start.sh
./quick-start.sh --server
```

The script asks for the control-panel domain, Agent root domain, and certificate email. It starts Traefik, obtains HTTPS certificates, and exposes only ports 80/443 publicly. For example, configure DNS records for `console.example.com` and `*.agents.example.com`.

> Both Quick Start launchers create `.env`, generate strong security secrets and an admin password, and preserve an existing server-mode configuration on subsequent runs. They use the same Docker Compose and environment contract.

---

### Method 3: Standard Docker Compose Setup

1. **Clone the repository and copy environment configuration:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mybay-ai/mybay.git
   cd mybay
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Configure required security values in `.env`:**
   ```bash
   # ENCRYPTION_KEY and the internal routing secret must each be 64 hex characters.
   openssl rand -hex 32
   openssl rand -hex 32

   # JWT_SECRET must contain at least 32 bytes.
   openssl rand -base64 48
   ```
   Assign the generated values to `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `MYBAY_INTERNAL_ROUTING_SECRET`, and `JWT_SECRET`. Also set `LOCAL_ADMIN_USERNAME` and a strong `LOCAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. These are the same required values enforced by `docker-compose.yml`.

3. **Start with Docker Compose:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
   *(Or `docker-compose up -d` on older Docker versions)*

4. **Access the Console:**
   Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. Log in with your configured admin credentials.

---

### Method 4: Local Node.js Development

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js 22.16.0 or later and npm
- Docker Engine / Docker Desktop installed and running (required for spawning Agent containers)

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Setup `.env` Configuration:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit `.env` and set `JWT_SECRET`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, and admin credentials.

3. **Run Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Production Build & Start:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   NODE_ENV=production npm start
   ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the control panel.

`VITE_PUBLIC_APP_URL` and `VITE_MYBAY_PLATFORM_ORIGIN` are build-time values. Docker Compose forwards them as Docker build arguments; changing them requires rebuilding the image. Runtime-only server variables continue to come from `.env`, while Compose always runs the control plane with `NODE_ENV=production`.

## Key Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | Web server listening port | `3000` |
| `NODE_ENV` | Server mode; Compose forces production | `development` in `.env.example` |
| `LOCAL_ADMIN_USERNAME` | Web console login username | `admin` |
| `LOCAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Web console login password | `change-me-now` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret key for signing session tokens (min 32 bytes) | *Replace in .env* |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | 64-char hex key for AES-256 key encryption | *Required* |
| `MYBAY_INTERNAL_ROUTING_SECRET` | 64-char hex secret for internal instance routing | *Required* |
| `VITE_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Public frontend URL embedded at Docker/Vite build time | `http://localhost:3000` |
| `VITE_MYBAY_PLATFORM_ORIGIN` | Platform origin passed to the frontend build | `http://localhost:3000` |
| `MY_BAY_IMAGE` | Docker image for spawned Hermes Agents | `nousresearch/hermes-agent` |
| `MYBAY_SQLITE_PATH` | Path to the on-machine SQLite database | `data/mybay.sqlite` |

---

## Local Data Storage

All runtime state, container configurations, chat histories, uploaded files, and logs are persisted locally in the `data/` directory:

```txt
data/
  mybay.sqlite        # On-machine SQLite database (instances, credentials, tasks and settings)
  instances/          # Agent workspace mounts and instance runtime data
  uploads/            # User uploaded files and assets
  logs/               # System and deployment logs
```

> **Note:** Do not commit the `data/` directory to git repository.

---

## Security Considerations

- This open-source edition is designed for trusted local environments and private servers.
- For a public server, use `./quick-start.sh --server`; it provisions Traefik and HTTPS and keeps dynamic Agent ports off the public interfaces.
- The Control Plane requires `/var/run/docker.sock` for instance lifecycle management. Access to this socket grants high-privilege control over the Docker daemon and can amount to host-level administrative capability.
- Treat MyBay administrator access as privileged host administration. Do not expose the Control Plane directly to the public internet without protection.
- For internet-facing deployments, use a strong administrator password, a hardened reverse proxy, HTTPS, and preferably a VPN, private network, or IP allowlist.
- Never commit `.env`, `data/`, or real API keys to version control.

---

## Runtime support status

- **Hermes Agent:** The supported runtime for the current preview create and lifecycle flow.
- **Pi Agent:** Experimental preview / coming soon. The UI cannot submit Pi deployments, and the API rejects `runtime_type=pi` with `PI_RUNTIME_PREVIEW_ONLY`. The included adapter and specification are integration previews, not a production support claim.

The full Pi backend deployment path is planned for a future release.

## Architecture

  C --> T[Traefik - server mode]
  D --> R[Hermes Agent Runtime Container]
  R --> A[Runtime API and UI]
  R --> M[Model Providers]
```

SQLite uses WAL journaling, transactional migrations, and explicit schema versioning. The control plane manages containers through the Docker socket; server mode places Traefik in front of the console and Agent runtimes. See the [architecture source of truth](./docs/architecture.md).

## Backup and diagnostics

```bash
npm run doctor
npm run doctor -- --json
npm run backup -- --output /secure/path/mybay-backup
npm run backup:verify -- --backup /secure/path/mybay-backup
```

Backup creates a consistent SQLite snapshot rather than copying a live WAL database. It includes instance workspaces and uploads when present, writes a checksummed manifest, and excludes `.env`, logs, caches, and container images. Treat backups as sensitive. See [self-host operations](./docs/self-host-operations.md).

Webhook authentication is `secret-required` by default in desktop, LAN, and server modes. Historical unauthenticated webhooks require both a stored `legacy-open` setting and the explicit unsafe `MYBAY_ALLOW_LEGACY_OPEN_WEBHOOKS=true` opt-in.

## Release and roadmap

Version tags run the full quality gate, create a clean checksummed source archive and SBOM, publish a multi-architecture GHCR image, and mark prerelease tags without moving stable `latest`.

See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for completed work and the focused next milestones.

## Agent Runtime Specification (`mybay.runtime.yaml`)

MyBay includes an extensible **Agent Runtime Specification** for future runtime integrations. Hermes Agent is the currently supported runtime; the Pi manifest is an experimental reference only:

- **JSON Schema Validation**: `/public/schemas/mybay.runtime.schema.json`
- **Example Runtimes**:
  - Hermes Agent: `/public/specs/mybay.runtime.yaml`
  - Pi Agent experimental reference: `/public/specs/pi.runtime.yaml`

With the `mybay.runtime.yaml` manifest, developers can declare container ports, health check endpoints, data volume mounts, and supported IM channels (Feishu, Telegram, Discord, Slack, etc.).
